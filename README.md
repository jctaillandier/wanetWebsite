First project done using Bootstrap framework

- Fairly responsive website

- goddamn collapsed menu bar doesn't want to close after click event. Tries a few tips from SO using jquery but can't figure it out

- Founders list data not aligned

- big logo not centered


As my first bootstrap projects I think I overused classes from Bootstrap libs
